www.foobar.com is typically configured as a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. This CNAME record points to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8), indicating that requests for www.foobar.com should be directed to that IP.

Web Server (Nginx): The web server (in this case, Nginx) plays a crucial role in handling incoming HTTP requests from users. It listens on port 80 and receives requests for the website. The web server can also perform tasks like SSL/TLS encryption, load balancing, caching, and serving static files.

Application Server: The application server is responsible for executing the server-side code of the web application. It runs the application's logic, processes user requests, and generates dynamic content to be sent back to the user's browser. It acts as an intermediary between the web server and the application code, handling business logic, data retrieval, and interaction with the database.

Database (MySQL): The MySQL database server is responsible for storing and managing the website's data. It is used to persistently store information such as user data, content, and other relevant data for the application. The application server communicates with the database server to retrieve and manipulate data as needed.

Server-User Communication: The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the HTTP protocol. When a user requests the website, their computer sends an HTTP request to the server. The server processes the request, retrieves the necessary resources from the application and database servers, and sends an HTTP response back to the user's computer with the requested content.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): This infrastructure has a single server, meaning that if the server fails, the entire website will become inaccessible. A hardware failure, network issue, or software crash could lead to extended downtime until the server is restored.

Downtime During Maintenance: Performing maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server, would result in downtime for the website. Users would be unable to access the site during these maintenance activities.

Limited Scalability: The infrastructure is not designed to handle a significant increase in incoming traffic. If there is a sudden surge in user requests, the single server may become overwhelmed, leading to degraded performance or even complete unavailability. Additional servers or load balancers would be needed to handle high traffic loads effectively.

To address these issues, a more robust infrastructure could involve distributing
